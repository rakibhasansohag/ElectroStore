# ElectroStore

A simple electronics store demo built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **shadcn/ui**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **NextAuth.js** (authentication), **MongoDB** (native driver), **Cloudinary** (image hosting), and **react-hook-form** for product forms. This repository is an assignment-ready project with public product browsing and a protected product management dashboard.

Adjust paths if your project places `components` under `src/components`.

## Environment variables (`.env.local`)

Create a `.env.local` in your project root and add the variables below. Example:

```env
# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

# MongoDB (connection string)
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Google OAuth (optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

# Optional: enable NextAuth debug logs
NEXTAUTH_DEBUG=true
```

> **Security**: never commit `.env.local` to source control. Use Vercel's Environment Variables UI for production.

---

## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+ (recommended)
* npm or pnpm
* MongoDB accessible (Atlas recommended)
* Cloudinary account for image uploads (or adapt to another provider)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rakibhasansohag/ElectroStore
cd electrostore
npm install
# or: pnpm install
```

### Local dev

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local # or create .env.local manually
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

### Build & Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

For Vercel deployment, connect your GitHub repo and set the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard. Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` points to your Vercel URL in production.

## API Routes

* `GET /api/products` â€” list products with query params: `search`, `sort` (`newest|oldest|price_asc|price_desc`), `page`, `limit`.
* `POST /api/products` â€” create product. Accepts multipart form data including `image` file (server uploads to Cloudinary). Required fields: `name`, `description`, `price`, `image`.
* `GET /api/products/:id` â€” get single product by `_id`.
* NextAuth endpoints: `/api/auth/*` (handled by NextAuth route).

---

## Important implementation notes

* **Auth & protected pages**: middleware restricts `/dashboard` routes. NextAuth uses JWT sessions. Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is stable across restarts and in production.
* **Database**: using the native MongoDB driver (no mongoose). `lib/mongodb.ts` exports `getDb()` and caches connections in development to avoid duplicate connections.
* **Image upload**: images are converted to Data URI and uploaded to Cloudinary server-side. You can change to direct unsigned uploads to Cloudinary for better performance.
* **Tailwind**: uses `darkMode: 'class'` and `next-themes` for toggling. Theme toggle stored in `localStorage`.
* **Case-sensitive imports**: on Windows dev machines you might import `@/components/ui/Input` vs `input.tsx` â€” ensure actual filenames and imports match exactly (case matters for Linux / Vercel builds).

---

## Troubleshooting (common issues)

### `Invalid URL` or `Failed to construct 'URL'` during `signIn()`

* Ensure you pass an absolute `callbackUrl` to `signIn()` or handle `redirect: false` and `router.push()` after sign-in. See login page implementation which normalizes callback URLs.

### `JWEDecryptionFailed` or next-auth session decryption errors

* Clear cookies and ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is unchanged across restarts. Set `NEXTAUTH_DEBUG=true` to see more logs.

### Vercel build type errors for API routes

* If you use Node-only libs (mongodb, cloudinary) in route handlers, add `export const runtime = 'nodejs';` at the top of that route file. If Vercel complains about typing, see the repo's `app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` which uses `// @ts-nocheck` to bypass strict signature mismatch.

### Images not loading in `next/image`

* Add Cloudinary remote pattern to `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [{ protocol: 'https', hostname: '**.cloudinary.com' }],
  },
};
```

## ðŸ“Œ Routes Summary
- `/` â€” Landing page (Hero, highlights, footer)
- `/login` & `/signup` â€” Authentication flows (NextAuth)
- `/products` â€” Product list with search + sort
- `/products/[id]` â€” Product details
- `/dashboard/add-product` â€” Protected add-product page

---

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- Using direct (unsigned) Cloudinary uploads from client to reduce server bandwidth and speed up uploads.
- Add server-side validation with `zod` or `yup` for stronger guarantees.
- Add product edit/delete with authorization checks and Cloudinary image deletion.
- Add unit/integration tests for API routes.
- Improve search performance with MongoDB text indexes or
